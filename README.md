- Interect with the Select button and the modern toast message

# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.
I have used total three state in this project. discussed as points.
1. When a user clicks the Select button will see the course name to the cart. I was used useState react hook for rendaring course name contionally. The state Initial value was an empty array, so that I can manage current state with an easy ways.
2. I was diclared a state for the total credit hours with the initial value 0. Because I was going to manage a number oparation. I was managed condition with a smart way using the state. React state is really a awesome thing that can easy the developers life.
3. I was declared useEffect state for fetching data from a json file. I'm familiar with it and I have basic idea how does it works. It can be use for Fetching data, Reading from local storage, and timers.

as per as I know till now, it is a best technique for managing states in a easy way in programming.
